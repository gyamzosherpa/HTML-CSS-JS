    <h2>Ternary operator</h2>
    <p>
      <span style="color: blue">Conditional (ternary) operator: </span> The
      conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes
      three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an
      expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:),
      and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This
      operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.
