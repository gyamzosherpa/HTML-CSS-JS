    <h1>Equality operators</h1>
    <h3>"==" vs "==="</h3>
    <p>
      "==" is the equality operator. It checks if the values on either side of
      the operator are equal. It perform type coercion. i.e "18" == 18 is true.
      <br />
      "===" is the strict equality operator. It checks if the values on either
      side of the operator are equal and of the same type. It does not perform
      type coercion. i.e "18" === 18 is false.
